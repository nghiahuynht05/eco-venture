              In two days of trekking at Do Quyen Peak, every day on average, we
              take 6-8km on the clear trail (many people use). The trekking path
              has a high elevation, especially a steep part of almost 1km at the
              mountain feet, hence for those with less physical exercise will be
              challenging. For those terrains, we need to have trekking shoes
              that have high-quality adhesion to hiking. Moreover, during the
              first trekking part, we had time to cross the stream. If the water
              level is high, we can take off our shoes to cross to avoid getting
              the shoes wet. We could bring sandals to cross the stream and the
              campsite.

              The steepness of K’lang Mountain is large, so trekking downhill
              will create a huge force on the knees, We should do the knees
              bandage to support the knees if your knees are weak.

              All meals in the forest are quite simple; however, they are rich
              in nutrition and bring the unique taste of that local. All the
              main meals including chicken or pork grilled, pork cooked with
              jungle vegetables, boiled jungle vegetables or stir fry, and fried
              egg are eaten with bamboo rice or sticky rice. Dessert is a
              popular fruit like oranges and watermelon. Breakfast is often
              instant noodles or cassava soup cooked with jungle vegetables.

              Daily drinking water is water bottles. During the K’lang trekking
              trip, besides the personal water that is brought by each person
              (around 1L/person), a porter will carry a certain amount of water
              to drink for the next day.
